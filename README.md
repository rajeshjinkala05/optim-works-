# Hospital & Appointment Management System

This project is a simple, full-stack Hospital & Appointment Management System developed using **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend, **MySQL** for the database, and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend. It allows hospitals to register, doctors to be added under hospitals, patients to register under specific doctors, and appointments to be booked between doctors and patients.

The system follows a modular design with separate APIs for hospital, doctor, patient, and appointment management. All frontend interactions are handled in a single `index.html` file with dynamic section toggling and real-time data loading using JavaScript.

This project is ideal for understanding basic CRUD operations, RESTful API integration, and frontend-backend connectivity in a real-world healthcare context. It provides a clean structure for building more advanced features like authentication, role-based access, and dashboards.

> Tech stack: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
